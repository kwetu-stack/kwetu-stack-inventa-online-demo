## Railway Deployment

This repo now includes a `Procfile` for Railway:

```bash
web: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --timeout 120
```

Recommended Railway variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-strong-secret
DEMO_MODE=true
```

Important:

* The app currently uses SQLite (`inventory.db`), so Railway should be treated as a demo host unless you move persistence to a managed database or mounted volume.
* With `DEMO_MODE=true`, visitors can access the app without login and all save actions are blocked to preserve the demo data.
